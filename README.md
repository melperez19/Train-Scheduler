[Click here to demo the site!](https://melperez19.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)

 Overview

This project is my creation of a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app  retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website will also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


 This application suits these basic specs.
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * This app calculates when the next train will arrive and is relative to the current time. Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.

Programs and Languages used are : HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, Firebase, and Moment.js
