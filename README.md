# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

### Overview

In this assignment, I will create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


 This application suits these basic specs.
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

Programs and Languages used are : HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, Firebase, and Moment.js
